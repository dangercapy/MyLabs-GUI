MyLabs-GUI provides the MyLabs application (https://github.com/dangercapy/MyLabs) to also provide a web-ui where you can find which servers are up, and which servers are not available.

Make sure to change the index.js line "let response = await fetch("http://localhost:8000" to the IP of your MyLabs host.
